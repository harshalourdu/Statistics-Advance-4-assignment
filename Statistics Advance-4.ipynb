    "<\n",
    "30\n",
    "n<30) and/or the population standard deviation is unknown. The test statistic follows a t-distribution with degrees of freedom that depend on the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A researcher is testing the effect of a new teaching method on student performance using a small sample of 25 students. Since the sample size is small, a t-test is used.\n",

    "# Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "One-tailed test: In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis specifies a direction (either greater than or less than). It is used when you are only interested in detecting an effect in one direction.\n",
